# INF8775 - Analyse et conception d'algorithmes (Polytechnique MontrÃ©al)

Repository containing the different assignments done during the INF8775 course I took at Polytechnique Montreal - Fall 2023.

* TP1 - The aim of this tutorial is to implement 3 different sorting algorithms in order to carry out an empirical and hybrid analysis. The impact of the recursivity threshold on the performance of the quick sort algorithm will also be analysed.
* TP2 - The subject concerns the construction of the tallest tower using concrete blocks of certain dimensions (height $\times$ width $\times$ length). Each plate must be built on top of the previous one. To solve this problem, we implement and compare the performance of 3 algorithms: a gluttonous algorithm, a dynamic programming-based algorithm and a probabilistic algorithm.
* TP3 - This last exercise is in fact a competition for the best algorithm for solving the following problem:
  
  > A group of primary school children need to be placed in a row (one behind the other). You are asked to carry out this task taking into account the following instruction: some pupils will quarrel if placed immediately one behind the other. You are therefore given a list of pairs of pupils who cannot be placed one behind the other without squabbling. We also want as many pupils as possible not to have their view obstructed by a taller pupil in front of them (directly or further ahead). You must therefore minimise the number of pupils having their view obstructed and the number of pupils bickering according to the following cost: pupils obstructed + 10 $\times$ (pairs of pupils bickering).
